"""Functional Hopfield retrieval operations.

Implements the pure one-step modern Hopfield retrieval equation:

    weights = softmax(beta * query @ memory.T)
    retrieved = weights @ memory

and optional multi-step retrieval, which repeats the one-step update:

    q_{t+1} = HopfieldRetrieval(q_t, M)

The function in this file is intentionally independent from nn.Module so it can
be tested directly and reused by HopfieldMemory.
